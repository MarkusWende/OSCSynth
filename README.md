# RoMaSynthi
The RoMaSythi is a software synthesizer, which generates sound in a combination 
of additive and a subtractive synthesis.

## Open Sound Control
The RoMaSynthesizer can be controlled via OSC. We used the app TouchOSC by 
Hexler, which is available in the Android and iOS Appstores.
Alternativley a PD file can be used to control the OSC controllable parameters.
